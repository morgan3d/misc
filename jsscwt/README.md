This is an online JavaScript and HTML implementation of the Stroop
Color Word Test from the psychology scientific literature, first
described in:

Stroop, J. R., [Studies of interference in serial verbal reactions](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Stroop/). J. Exp. Psychol. 18, 643â€“662, 1935. doi: 10.1037/h0054651

For an analysis of methods of scoring SCWT, see:

Scarpina F, Tagini S., [The Stroop Color and Word Test](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00557/full). Front. Psychol. 2017;8:557. Published 2017 Apr 12. doi:10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00557


This implementation does not compute a baseline. Instead, it is
designed as a game/neurological training task in which the player
seeks to complete reading the third CW sequence as quickly as
possible. The score is a single time which they seek to minimize over
trials. I created this to support colleagues in Neuroscience who
needed an online method for automatically generating SCWT-style
stimuli.
