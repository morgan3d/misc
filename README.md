This repository contains miscellaneous code from throughout my career.

I regularly add to this repo but do not support this code through github--use it at your own risk, and please don't send
feature requests or ask for help with it. Some of it was written while I was an undergraduate
and may not compile on modern machines.

Some additional open source projects that I _do_ actively support are:

- [quadplay](https://github.com/morgan3d/quadplay) Javascript web-based fantasy video game console
- [The G3D Innovation Engine](https://casual-effects.com/g3d) C++ 3D graphics library
- [Markdeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep) Document beautification tool
- [iCompile](https://casual-effects.com/g3d/G3D10/build/manual/icompile-manual.html) Zero-configuration build system
- [include.js](https://morgan3d.github.io/include.js/) Cross-domain, cross-browser HTML include tag
- [codeheart.js](http://casual-effects.com/codeheart) Javascript 2D game library
