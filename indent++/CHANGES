Morgan McGuire:
        + All of my changes are controlled by the JAVASCRIPT macro
        + Changed the code to use my preferred defaults and overwrite
          the input file automatically so that JavaScript programmers
          not yet familiar with the command line could drag and drop 
          files onto the script for automatic indentation.
        + Added precompiled binary for OS X in bin/osx (produced using 
          icompile with no changes) because the default configure/makefile
          did not work
        + Acknowledged that these changes are heretical to Unix/C/C++
          programmers.  Don't use my version if it offends you.

2012/03/18
	+ add rpm script.
	+ fixes for DESTDIR in makefiles
	+ add cb++ script to install-rules
	+ integrate patch from Debian package, to search for bcpp.cfg in
	  user's home-directory and optionally a compile-time specific
	  directory.
	+ add dpkg script from Debian package, for testing.
	+ updated configure script macros
	+ drop mkdirs.sh, using "mkdir -p"
	+ update config.guess, config.sub

2009/06/30
	+ updated configure scripts
	+ improve exec-sql parser, detecting inline comments beginning with
	  "--".
	+ fix a case where multi-line indent was set during a #define, and
	  not reset on completion of the #define, causing the following code
	  to be indented.
	+ check for braces or preprocessor-level before indenting comments
	  which are on a line without code.
	+ improve config-file parser, which used strstr...
	+ add keep_code_with_comment option, to merge inline-comments with
	  the code immediately following, rather than merging (for example)
	  with trailing "}" (request by Daniel Lin).

2005/07/25
	+ add COPYING (request by Peter Hille).
	+ fixes for Intel 9.0 compiler-warnings.
	+ add AC_EXEEXT and AC_OBJEXT checks to configure properly with cygwin.

2005/05/16
	+ fixes to build with g++ 2.95.3
	+ add .SUFFIXES rule to build with Solaris make.

2005/04/10
	+ correct some regressions introduced by 2004/10/27:
	  + check if a line began as part of a quoted string string before
	    computing its indentation.
	  + count indent-level for curly-braces within #define's.
	+ improve configure check for g++ warnings (from ncurses).

2004/10/27
	+ correct logic that tracks state of preprocessor lines that continue
	  from one line to the next.  The additional lines were not marked
	  as preprocessor lines (report by Edward Bishop).
	+ updated configure script, fixes a check that added some gcc warning
	  options which are not recognized by g++.

2003/11/03
	+ correct one of the valgrind fixes from 2003/04/23 which used delete[]
	  in a special case where delete was correct (reports by Gert van de
	  Kraats <Gert.vandeKraats@getronics.com> and John Whitley
	  <JSWHITLEY@mail.dstl.gov.uk>).

2003/04/23
	+ fix several mismatches between new and delete (versus delete[])
	  reported by valgrind.
	+ add place_top_brace_on_new_line to config, with corresponding
	  command-line options -tbcl and tbnl to disable or enable it
	  respectively.  This is for the special case of the top-level
	  brace, e.g., at the function-level, to better match K&R style
	  braces (request by Daniel Lin).
	+ modified run-test script to facilitate testing variations of bcpp.cfg

2002/11/24
	+ check in OutputToOutFile() for a trailing C-comment fragment which
	  happened to precede code on the same line, e.g.,
		*/ a = b;
	  and split the line to avoid constructing
		a = b; */
	  (reports by Andreas Werner and Yanir Lubetkin
	  <yanir.lubetkin@emblaze.com>
	+ add isFinalComment() check to ensure that embedded comments are
	  not moved, e.g.,
		void myFunct(int /*number*/, float* /*data*/);
	  (report by Andreas Werner).

2002/11/23
	+ add a simple configure script.
	+ rename UNIX makefile to makefile.unx, changing compiler definition
	  from "gcc -x g++" to "g++", since that no longer works with gcc 3.2
	  (report by Don Park <don.park@beehivegames.com>).
	+ remove obsolete 'unix' subdirectory.

2002/05/18
	+ add indent_both_braces config-file option and corresponding
	  command-line -nbbi, -ybbi options to allow user to indent both
	  leading/trailing braces of a block by one level (adapted from patch
	  by Brad Mettee <bmettee@clark.net>).

	+ add brace_indent config-file option and corresponding command-line
	  -nbi, -ybi options to allow user to indent the trailing brace of a
	  block to align with its content rather than the beginning of the
	  block (detailed request by Edwin Robert Tisdale
	  <E.Robert.Tisdale@jpl.nasa.gov>)

	+ correct isContinuation() by ignoring backslash characters within
	  comments.  This makes it handle comment blocks such as 
		 /*******\
		  * BUG *
		 \*******/
	  (reported by Andreas Werner <werner@vircinity.com>).

	+ add makefile.blc for Borland C (from Chris Elliott <cje2@york.ac.uk>).

	+ remove references to obsolete email address <dickey@clark.net>

	+ add CHANGES file, document the sets of changes I marked in RCS

	+ add MANIFEST file.

1999/08/10
	+ makefile: do not link with -lg++ anymore

	+ makefile:  change $D to "./", to make vile follow the compiler
	  warnings more easily

	+ add __FILE__ to traceOutput() calls

	+ fixes to compile on SunOS 4.x, which needs the <string.h> stuff
	  prototyped also, change interface of traceInput() and traceOutput()
	  to add __FILE__

	+ fix a case Jeff Gilliat pointed out - an inline C comment fragment
	  resulted in commenting out the code on that line.

	+ mods in IndentNonBraces() which serve to distinguish "public:" which
	  is a class scope from "public" which is a Java type.  Otherwise we
	  get odd indention for the latter case.

	+ backup.cpp: had allocated one char too few for ".orig" suffix

1999/01/21
	+ rename the backup file to .orig, since "~" confuses WinNT's directory
	  scanning, making it return the same file more than once.

	+ open the output in binary mode, so we get ^J's rather than ^M^J's

1999/01/04
	+ kludge to ifdef for g++ versus M$ Visual C++

	+ kludge to compile in case we have the misfortune to use gcc 2.8.1
	  with Solaris's header files (some idiot decided to undef __STDC__ in
	  g++ because they disapprove of using __STDC__ for ifdef'ing).

	+ change defaults in bcpp.cfg to use_tabs=yes, and
	  comments_with_code=33 (the original bpp.cfg is in top-level).

	+ baseq.cpp:  fix so we do not try to peek into a negative index

	+ add top-level bcpp.cfg, indent.bat, indent.cfg as part of port to
	  win32.

	+ add txtdocs/manual.txt to distribution, updated wpdocs/manual.doc

1999/01/02
	+ mods to "work" with tisca.h, which contains a number of comments
	  within long multi-line comments.  This isn't quite right, since lines
	  containing only a backslash are deleted, where they should be
	  combined just like blank lines.

	+ add run-test file (used with regression test-cases not part of the
	  distribution).

	+ implement html.cpp, to provide limited support for indenting
	  JavaScript embedded in HTML files.

	+ split-out backup.cpp to support renaming of the original file,
	  preserving its modification-time, to allow recovery if the indent is
	  not needed (makes no change), or otherwise should be discarded.

	+ implement verbose.cpp, to support interactions such as stopping
	  processing a set of files on an error.

	+ change scattered printf's to call verbose(), and fprintf(stderr's to
	  warning().

	+ rewrote ReadLine so it doesn't use fseek/ftell (which is a porting
	  problem).

	+ config.cpp:  removed a lot of ugly/repetitious code

	+ config.cpp:  moved ShowConfig here from bcpp.cpp

	+ debug.cpp:  change trace() calls to not use stderr explicitly.

1997/04/04
	+ first draft of logic to reset indent-stack at the end of a multi-line
	  preprocessor command.  also, fixed (?) a bug in splitting
	  continuation-line (but there's more)

	+ allow unrecognized preprocessor-lines to be indented

	+ refine a change to allow for things like "else return;"

	+ replaced a couple of strcmp calls by CompareKeyword to allow for
	  matching both "else" and "else if" statements.

	+ fixes for places where we split a line that has continuation-marker
	  on the end.  while I was at it, trim redundant whitespace before the
	  '\', to make it uniform.

1997/01/07
	+ tabs.cpp:  fix a place where I trimmed trailing blanks from data w/o
	  trimming state, causing bogus results with baseobj.hh, due to overrun
	  in later logic.

	+ lots of spelling corrections.

	+ fixes for stricter gcc warnings

1996/12/24
	+ updated copyright notices.

	+ refined adjustment of inline comments to work with hanging.cpp, which
	  doesn't take that into account.

	+ remove unused logic for adjustHangingComment, since I'm doing this in
	  a different way.

1996/12/17
	+ execsql.cpp:  refined hanging-indents to account for statements other
	  than the two block-styles we use

	+ make SqlStruct a class

1996/12/12
	+ shift-adjust dangling else{} block

	+ makefile:  record the debug-ifdefs

	+ hanging.cpp:  make HangStruct class to get rid of static variables

	+ bcpp.h:  made HangStruct class

	+ change hang_state from an int to a class

	+ made singleIndentLen obsolete via hanging.cpp

1996/12/06
	+ tabs.cpp:  mods to allow tabs in OutputStruct.filler

	+ fix a few leaks

	+ ensure that hanging comments remain hanging when re-indenting.

	+ use tabs for OutputStruct.filler

1996/12/05
	+ tabs.cpp:  correct leading-whitespace conversion (space is printable
	  ;-)

	+ hanging.cpp:  remove redundant reset of hang_state

	+ debug.cpp:  SunOS 4.x needs stdlib.h for size_t

	+ add InputStruct.offset

	+ add OutputStruct.splitElseIf

	+ remove IndentStruct.firstPass, because hanging.cpp does it better

	+ mods to preserve code-fragment's offset to use in shifting
	  block-indented C-style comments

	+ fixes for offset adjustment due to stripping whitespace from
	  fragments in DecodeLine

	+ first cut of logic to pass offset of code-fragments into InputStruct
	  (to use for categorizing hanging comments)

	+ revised logic for split else/if statement using flag 'splitElseIf'. 
	  this fixes the problem of indenting the code undef 'if'.

	+ mods to make TestLineHasCode look at the parse-state (which is more
	  reliable)

	+ remove IndentStruct.firstPass logic, since hanging.cpp does it better

	+ add pBFlag to OutputStruct to use in hanging.cpp

1996/11/15
	+ tabs.cpp:  correct off-by-one in return from skipEscape() that ate
	  trailing quote.

	+ bcpp.h:  rename OutputStruct.pState to OutputStruct.pCFlag

	+ bcpp.h:  add OutputStruct.pBFlag

	+ use OutputStruct.indentHangs

	+ split-out hanging.cpp

	+ hanging.cpp:  add 'do_aggreg' flag

	+ hanging.cpp:  use new member of OutputStruct, indentHangs to allow
	  merge with info from execsql.cpp

1996/11/08
	+ move emptyString to bcpp.h

	+ pass-in Config struct to IndentSQL, making it pass by ref everywhere

	+ move some string-parsing to strings.cpp, to re-use in execsql.cpp

	+ move debug/trace code to debug.cpp

	+ move input/output/indent definitions to bcpp.h

	+ align successive else/if

	+ don't set interfunction-spacing for lines that happen to have R_CURL,
	  if there's more on the line.

	+ add indent_exec_sql to bcpp.cfg

	+ execsql.cpp - quick hack to indent non-keyword stuff extra

	+ move some functions to strings.cpp from bcpp.cpp, for use in
	  execsql.cpp

1996/11/06
	+ restructured keyword-lookup to add 3rd type (blockLine).  use this to
	  fix case (successive lines) with "while", "switch" -- the
	  curly-braces for "switch" weren't indented under "switch".

	+ also, dropped special logic for singleIndentLen, making it the same
	  as a standard indent (was too ugly).

1996/11/05
	+ propagate parse-state via InputStruct to OutputStruct.

	+ correct potential indention of continued-string fragments.

1996/11/04
	+ moved string-table to config.cpp

	+ fix uninitialized-memory-ref (Purify)

	+ unused parameter.

	+ add indent_preprocessor

	+ simplify config.cpp a little using overloading

	+ corrected some minor bugs affecting indention

	+ add "#else" to typeOfPreP(), along with all other standard
	  directives.

	+ use enum rather than int for 'attrib' types.  change name of one
	  'attrib' type to make it easier to maintain.  fixes for TRACE.

	+ first cut of indent_preprocessor option

	+ modify so that both comma and semicolon are treated specially after
	  '}', to make data lists work properly

	+ correct a couple of special cases with multi-indent

1996/10/31
	+ fixes for memory leaks

	+ corrections to tab computation

	+ add special state for '#' pre-processor lines

	+ makefile - move some symbols to accommodate non-g++

	+ add POUNDC

	+ mods to track preprocessor-lines

	+ reduce ConstructLine to a single-level switch, rather than the nested
	  one that will get in the way of mods for execsql

	+ refined logic in dontHangComment(), fixing a case I missed before.

	+ correct a logical-reduction for matching against PreP types

	+ suppress inter-function spacing before "#endif"

	+ add pType to OutputStruct so I can tag them as PreP when needed

	+ fix while-loop that was expressed as for-loop with break

	+ undid unnecessary if-level in ConstructLine

	+ restore leading tabs in comments if we're expanding tabs

	+ moved the non-printing character conversion to tabs.cpp

1996/10/20
	+ moved delete for lineState into  bcpp.cpp

	+ make pString in/out for ExpandTabs

	+ modify ExpandTabs to maintain a string of CharState values

	+ corrected state: allow tab-expansion in // comments

	+ add strings.cpp

	+ make pString in/out for ExpandTabs

	+ fixes for include-order (bcpp.h should be last)

	+ reduce FindStartofComment and FindEndofComment to return index
	  instead of pointers

	+ revised FindPunctuation so it returns an index rather than a pointer,
	  and uses the pLineState info so that we can easily discard quoted
	  punctuation (which didn't work for a complicated string, e.g.,
	  "'\\0','\\0'}").

	+ changed allocation scheme of lineState

	+ drop CComments param of DecodeLine, since pLineState contains proper
	  info

	+ fixes for blank-lines:  ensure that we don't emit trailing
	  blank-lines in a file, that except for inter-function blanks, we
	  reduce runs of blank lines to a single blank, and that there's no
	  lines (even comments) that come out with trailing whitespace.

	+ simplify allocation/deallocation in DecodeLine by leaving pLineData
	  alone.

	+ a couple of Purify-fixes

	+ modify ExpandTabs to maintain a string of CharState values; use this
	  to retain parsing state so I can correct blank-trimming (so that
	  continuation lines of a string aren't trimmed!).

1996/10/12
	+ split-out bcpp.h and tabs.cpp

	+ moved tab-expansion (and tab-spacing) into separate file, first to
	  fix an error in tab-expansion (wrong fill amount), then to allow
	  rewrite to capture left/right CharState, to prevent quoted tabs from
	  being expanded.  Also, moved L_CURL, R_CURL, DQUOTE, SQUOTE into
	  config.h, making capitalization consistent.

	+ fixes for multi-line C comments

	+ implement shiftToMatchSingleIndent, peekIndexOfBrace,
	  chainedSingleIndent

	+ better logic in resetSingleIndent(), to reset all pending
	  single-indents

	+ ifdef'd trace code so I don't have to uncomment it added clause in
	  IndentNonBraceCode to (try to) reset singleIndentLen immediately
	  after "{" -- works in one place but not another

	+ eliminate single-char constant-strings to use strchr instead of
	  strstr.  use FindPunctuation to simplify some logic

	+ new function CompareKeyword fixes parse ambiguity with strstr allow
	  combination of tabs and spaces.
